    "A **linear relationship** between two variables is one in which the scatterplot of them looks roughly like a line.  **Linear regression** is a method for modelling how a **dependent variable** linearly depends on one or more **independent variables**.  The dependent variable (also called a **response variable** and many other things) is what we are trying to model or predict, and is usually denoted $Y$.  The independent variables (also called **explanatory** or **input variables**) are the information we are using to make the predictiong, and are usually denoted $X_1, X_2, ...$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear relationship is: $$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_n X_n + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ (epsilon) represents the error.\n",
    "\n",
